# Music Mixer

### Music DJ Application

*Feb 3, 2019*

App that allows dragging and dropping of audio tracks onto music players.  Once dropped the song will play on a loop of `4366ms` synced with all the other tracks.  The user then has the option to change volume, mute the specific audio piece, remove audio piece on next loop restart, or force remove it.  

**TO RUN**

Simply open the `index.html` in any modern web browser.  Unfortunately we do not support previous versions of Internet Explorer due to modern features needed to run the app.

### Reason for Application
This project was designed for **Trevor Van Rys** for **Interactive Media Design** at **Fanshawe College**

Purpose is to demonstrate the ability to use `drag`, `dragend`, `dragover`, `dragstart` and to be able to manipulate audio.

### Inspiration
This project was inspired by [Incredibox](https://www.incredibox.com/demo/ "incredibox.com")

We also took inspiration from a dj, with music controls with a launch pad.
